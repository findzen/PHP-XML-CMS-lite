		This file serves as a map of urls to ids. Requests are routed through the Fz_XML_Controller, 
		which asks the Fz_XML_Model to retrieve data for the request.
		
		The Fz_XML_Model searches this XML file for a match based on the structure defined here. 
		The request is converted to an array split by forward slashes ('/'), so a request of 
		
			/foo/bar
		
		would be converted into:
		
		 	[ 'foo', 'bar' ]
		
		and the Fz_XML_Model would search this file for nodes with href values matching the request:
		
		 	<page id="my-foo-id" href="foo" title="My Foo Title">
				<page id="my-bar-id" href="bar" title="My Bar Title"/>
			</page>
		
		When a match is found, the Fz_XML_Model does one of two things:
		
			1. 	If the match contains a redirect attribute, this value is passed back to the
				Fz_XML_Controller which handles the redirect.
				
				<page href="redirect-example" redirect="foo/bar"/>
				
			2.	If the match does not contain a redirect, the Fz_XML_Model searches the content XML
				for a matching id and returns this data to the Fz_XML_Controller along with global variables
				(declared in the content XML) and this site map (for building the navigation).

		<page href="redirect-example" redirect="hello-world" title="Redirect example"/>
		<page id="hello-world" href="hello-world" title="Hello, world!"/>
